# Train-Scheduler
### Overview
In this assignment, I created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. This app retrieves and manipulates information with Moment.js. This website also provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

### Assignment Instructions
